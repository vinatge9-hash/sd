# Niyantri Cafe Website

This repository contains a 5-page static website for Niyantri Cafe (Hyderabad, India) built with Tailwind CSS. Pages include Home, Menu, Cart, About, and Contact.

How to run locally:
- Open any page (index.html) directly in a browser, or serve via a local server.
- The site uses a client-side cart with localStorage. Add items from the Menu page, view the cart, and checkout with PayPal Sandbox.

Key features:
- Responsive navigation with a mobile hamburger menu
- Tailwind CSS-based styling and subtle scroll and page-load animations
- Glassmorphism accents and a warm coffee color palette
- PayPal Sandbox integration (client-id: sb)
- All pages include a header with Cart count, and a 2025 copyright in the footer
- Placeholder address for Hyderabad on the Contact page
- Inline SVG icons and semantic HTML

Note: The PayPal sandbox environment is used for testing; replace client-id if moving to production.
